- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamiemacp
- 👀 I’m interested in computational fluid dynamics and mathematical modeling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and Adaptive grid methods.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but maybe later after more set up. :)
- 📫 How to reach me: will get back to this some other time.
